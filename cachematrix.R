## The first function, "makeCacheMatrix" creates a special "matrix". The second function
## The "cacheSolve" function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function.
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation.
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse matrix in the cache
## via the setsolve function.

##set the value of the matrix,get the value of the matrix,set the value of the inverse and get the value of the inverse
